# Bolt Theme Starter
----

This is a slightly opinionated boilerplate / starter for  Bolt CMS themes.  

It uses template inheritance. All blocks located in `base.html.twig` are there for example purposes only. The structure is the same. 

I've created this to jump start my own projects

If you're using this.. Remove this readme content and replace it with your own for your theme if you wish to publish it to the Bolt Marketplace.
