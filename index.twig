{#
 # our main entry point to our "homepage" and anything else that uses index.twig
 #
 # we will extend our base template. This is the "base.html.twig". For any area we need we will use the
 # {% block %}{% endblock %} syntax.
 #
 # This example will also over write some areas from the base and include certain files from the base. See
 # Each block example for more in depth examples :)
 #
 # If you need a specific block you'll need to add this to the base. This may to be rigid for you. If that is the
 # case you can follow Bolt's "Bolt-2016" theme and use includes instead of a base.html.twig with blocks and
 # inheritence.
